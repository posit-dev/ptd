# To delete these alerts, simply removing the configMap that uses this method will not work.
# Replace file contents with the following and apply in order to delete the alerts
# (repeat the deleteRules entry for each uid listed below):
# apiVersion: 1
# deleteRules:
#   - orgId: 1
#     uid: azure_storage_availability_low
#   - orgId: 1
#     uid: azure_storage_latency_high
#
# See https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/set-up/provision-alerting-resources/file-provisioning/
#
# Note: alert annotations reference {{$labels.cluster}}. For Azure Monitor-sourced metrics,
# this label is injected by the prometheus.relabel.default block in grafana_alloy.py.
# If Alloy is not running or relabeling is misconfigured, the label will be absent and
# the annotation will render as "in cluster " (blank).
