# PTD AWS Account IDs
# This file is sourced by direnv to set environment variables for AWS account lookups.
#
# SETUP:
# 1. Copy this file to accounts.env: cp accounts.env.example accounts.env
# 2. Fill in your AWS account IDs below
# 3. Run `direnv allow` to load the variables
#
# NOTE: These variables are optional. If not set, PTD will automatically detect
# your AWS account ID via STS GetCallerIdentity when credentials are available.
# Setting these provides a faster lookup path based on your AWS_PROFILE name.
#
# PROFILE NAMING CONVENTION:
# The account lookup matches AWS_PROFILE names by their suffix (case-insensitive):
#
#   Profile suffix        Environment variable
#   ----------------      ---------------------------
#   -staging              PTD_AWS_ACCOUNT_STAGING
#   -production           PTD_AWS_ACCOUNT_PRODUCTION
#   -team                 PTD_AWS_ACCOUNT_TEAM
#   -lab-staging          PTD_AWS_ACCOUNT_LAB_STAGING
#   -lab-production       PTD_AWS_ACCOUNT_LAB_PRODUCTION
#
# Examples:
#   AWS_PROFILE="mycompany-staging"      → PTD_AWS_ACCOUNT_STAGING
#   AWS_PROFILE="acme-corp-production"   → PTD_AWS_ACCOUNT_PRODUCTION
#   AWS_PROFILE="ptd-lab-staging"        → PTD_AWS_ACCOUNT_LAB_STAGING
#
# Any prefix before the suffix is allowed (e.g., "my-company-staging" works).

export PTD_AWS_ACCOUNT_STAGING=""
export PTD_AWS_ACCOUNT_PRODUCTION=""

# Additional environment mappings (optional, for multi-environment setups):
# export PTD_AWS_ACCOUNT_TEAM=""
# export PTD_AWS_ACCOUNT_LAB_STAGING=""
# export PTD_AWS_ACCOUNT_LAB_PRODUCTION=""
