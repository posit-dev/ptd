# hello, fellow travelers

<p style="font-size:2em;text-align:center">
🎒 👜 🧮 🧭 🗺️ 📜 ⚗️ 🛃
</p>

::: {.notes}
Thanks for joining us on this quick sidequest from the "Top N"! We're joining you today to
represent Posit Team Dedicated, or "PTD".
:::

# whomst? {background-image="pyramid-cake.png"}

<p style="margin:300px">
&nbsp;
</p>

::: {.notes}
We, PTD, are a small team of humans who have previously worked on other product teams and
within Solution Engineering. We've been working closely with product teams, sales,
solution engineering, really everyone, to make sure we're asking good questions and
building on knowledge gained from practical experience.
:::


# 🤔 ⁉️

::: {.incremental}
- What is PTD?
- For whom is PTD?
- Why PTD now?
:::

::: {.notes}
We're going to try to answer a few questions including "What is PTD?",
"For whom is PTD?", and "Why PTD now?".

## axes

::: {.incremental}
- $x = GRC$ <q style="display:block;color:#faa;">Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance</q>
- $y = IT$ <q style="display:block;color:#afa;">IT Capacity</q>
:::

::: {.notes}
The axes here are x="GRC", meaning "Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance"
requirements, and y="IT" for "IT capacity", which roughly means available humans with
knowledge, skills, and time to operate Posit products.
:::

## {background-image="xy-base.png"}

# how do they do it?

::: {.notes}
So how do they meet their data science needs with Posit products today?

We're going to make some broad generalizations that will probably fall apart at the edges,
but please suspend your disbelief for a bit.
:::

---

## {background-image="xy-blhl.png"}

<h3 style="margin-left:200px;">posit.cloud</h3>

::: {.notes}
They use posit.cloud!

For example, consider the Higher Education customers, both instructors and students, who
need a fully managed offering. They're using open data sets, and access controls are often
managed at the individual level.
:::

---

## {background-image="xy-thhl.png"}

<h3 style="margin-left:200px;">
self-hosted &amp; self-managed
</h3>

::: {.notes}
They run it themselves! (including Posit documentation and Posit customer success)

This could include a huge swath of the customer base.
:::

---

## {background-image="xy-trhl.png"}

<h3 style="margin-left:200px;">
self-hosted &amp; self-managed (high GRC)
</h3>

::: {.notes}
For example, consider the Credit Card Company where both GRC requirements and IT capacity
are high. They're very comfortable with Kubernetes and AWS, with operational knowledge
across all engineering teams.
:::

---

## {background-image="xy-brhl.png"}

<h3 style="margin-left:200px;">
outsourced to managed service providers
</h3>

::: {.notes}
They pay someone else to do it!

Consider the Healthcare Provider where GRC requirements are high, but IT capacity is
fairly low. There's no Kubernetes here, and may not even be elastic cloud resources
available.
:::

## {background-image="xy-rhhl-arrows.png"}

<h3 style="margin-left:200px;">
IT capacity drain? 😯
</h3>

::: {.notes}
Many organizations are struggling to retain the IT capacity necessary to operate
self-hosted, self-managed installations, but are reluctant to resort to outsourcing to MSP
due to the high GRC requirements.
:::

# perfect world? {background-image="xy-rhhl.png"}

<!--<h2 style="margin-top:0px;">
perfect world?
</h2>-->

::: {.notes}
So what would a perfect world look like for these customers with high GRC requirements?
:::

# perfect world?

::: {.incremental}
- meet GRC requirements 🔏
- less work to validate upgrades are safe ⌛💨
- customer-specific change (security, experimental feature) 🛠️
:::

::: {.notes}
Meeting GRC requirements is required! Let's make sure all the checkboxes are checked,
locks are locked, and there's an audit trail to prove it.

These organizations know that keeping up to date is important, but the cost/benefit often
favors staying on older versions rather than risking data and productivity loss.

Integrating with other systems often requires changes that can't or shouldn't be built
into Posit products. Supporting teams with specialized needs often requires enabling
experimental features, but running an unsupported build is not an option.
:::

# so what are we doing?

::: {.incremental}
- (story time first)
:::

::: {.notes}
A story not foreign to Customer Success, Sales, or Solutions Engineering

Showing Posit Team. Folks are getting excited.

So you run this for us right?

So we can run it on Windows?

Named Operator = Person

Control Room = One source for all Posit actions

Very simple requests - coordinated with customers

## glossary

- control room - <q style="display:block;color:#faa">Posit-owned, secure & named access to workload accounts, check-boxes</q>

<img src="ptd-architecture.png">

::: {.notes}
To show you some of the tools we are using

Pulumi manages most of the persistent state

EKS is ephemeral and replaceable
:::

# zoom in on k8s

---

<img src="team-operator-components.png">

::: {.notes}
Inside of EKS we deploy the products in off-host execution

This is managed entirely by the Team Operator
:::

---

<img src="team-operator-outputs.png">

::: {.notes}
Lots of things that the operator does (or will do)

Goal is to write code to manage Posit Team

(lower the human effort)
:::

# goals

Make the products better

Our team has a history of being involved w/ product teams
